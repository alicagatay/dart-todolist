todolist is a simple command-line application I made using the Dart programming language. The main purpose of the app is to write down all the things the user has noted to a list, just like a normal todo list application. It has 3 main functions:

Add --> Adding an item to a list.

Remove --> Removing an item from a list.

Display --> Displaying all of the items in the list.

Exit --> Exiting the application.

Note: For now, the list you create is not savable, but implementing that idea is on my plans for the next commit. Also I am planning to implement the idea of being able to create different lists for different stuff.
